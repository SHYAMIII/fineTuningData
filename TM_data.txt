Customer engagement is becoming an essential component for numerous businesses. Making deep and personalized connections with clients is now a significant distinction between successful businesses and their competitors. As a result, organizations are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) to uncover new opportunities for consumer interaction.

Salesforce, a prominent CRM platform, has been at the forefront of this change, employing artificial intelligence to transform how organizations connect with their customers and increase overall performance.

In this article, we would like to explain how artificial intelligence (AI) in Salesforce is helping businesses unleash untapped potential that drives customer engagement.

Salesforce AI Solutions

Salesforce offers several AI technologies and has integrated them into Salesforce suite products such as Service Cloud, Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Commerce Cloud.

Enhancing Customer Engagement

Salesforce’s AI capabilities assist organizations in swiftly analyzing data, automating tedious operations, and developing insights to allow effective and speedy decision-making. It contributes to increased sales and marketing, greater efficiency, and a better customer experience.

Salesforce is driving customer engagement by:

1.Personalization:AI in Salesforce allows organizations to dive deeply into customer data and preferences, providing vital insights. Businesses can segment their consumer base, discover patterns, and create personalized experiences that resonate with individual requirements.

– The release of Sales Planning is expected in June 2023.

4. Pay Now

Pay Now makes the buying process simple for customers. This feature automates purchasing activities, making it user-friendly. Customers can now make purchases using the payment method of their choice. Furthermore, payment capabilities can be integrated with invoices, email or sms in this new feature.

– Pay Now and the Reorder Portal are expected to go live in June 2023.

5. Tableau for Sales

Tableau is a well-known data visualization platform. It is being combined with Data Cloud and Einstein GPT to get its benefits for sales. Using this combination, the sales leaders can explore any data. This further helps them in deciding and creating new sales strategies for better results.

– Tableau is generally available, while Data Cloud and Einstein GPT are in closed pilot.

Do you want to leverage the power of a CRM to build a healthy relationship with your customers and give them the best buying experience?  With an array of options available, you may get confused about choosing the right CRM for your business.

You don’t need to worry about that. We here in this article will let you know

. So let’s dive into it.

What is a CRM system?

A customer relationship management system enables you to build stronger and more profitable relationships with your clients and prospects. It helps you track and nurture your leads, streamline processes, boost your employees’ productivity,and more.

,

and more.

A CRM integrates all your customer data in one place, making it easy for you to manage and draw explainable insights. Moreover, it consolidates every part of your communication via emails, texts, social media, website and more. Thus giving you a connected eco-system with easy accessibility of information across your organization.

And the best part is it empowers you to build strategies that help you become a customer-centric company.

Why your business needs CRM?

A CRM provides many benefits to help your business experience unparalleled growth and greater profitability. Here we have listed a few of them-

- Break your company silos

Break your company silos

A CRM helps you get over organizational silos which negatively impact customers’ and sales prospects’ experiences. It works as a shared platform that lends greater visibility into customer interactions across every department.

Moreover, a CRM gives your employees access to detailed customer information and enables them to work collaboratively to give connected experiences to customers.

- Improved customer Service

Improved customer Service

“Customer service is the new marketing; it’s what differentiates one business from another “- Jay Baer.

In today’s world,  customers expect fast resolution of their issues with personalized support.CRM enables your employees to give satisfactory and quick responses to customer queries by providing a single shared view of customers’ details, e.g. past purchase orders, previous interactions details, etc. Overall, a CRM helps you improve your customer service quality.

steps accordingly.

- Provide Personalized Experiences

Provide Personalized Experiences

With changing times, customers’ needs and wants also keep evolving. A CRM enables you to understand your prospects’ needs and deliver personalized experiences. It provides a centralized database with all the customer information at your fingertips. You get knowledge of your clients’ behavior, interests, pain points, demographics, and more. With all this information in your hand, you can give personalized offerings to your customers and differentiate your brand.

How to choose the right CRM?

The right CRM should solve your business challenges and help you accomplish your objectives. In addition, it should delight your customers at every step of the sales funnel.

- Analyze your needs

Analyze your needs

The first and foremost step you must take before choosing the right CRM is to identify your business goals. You should be clear on what you intend to accomplish and the issues you want your CRM to address. You may want to optimize your processes, track sales opportunities, reduce information silos, manage customer relations, or have any other need specific to your business.

Moreover, one of the constructive strategies would be to list your goals and then choose an effective CRM that best serves your purpose. It will save you from paying for CRM features unnecessary for your business at the current stage.

You can also consult your organization’s employees, including sales, marketing, customer support etc., to know how a CRM can be instrumental in increasing their productivity.

- Examine CRM features

Examine CRM features

Every business has its unique set of challenges, processes and business environment. Choosing a CRM that addresses your specific needs, increases operational efficiency, and enhances your customer experiences is the best.

In addition, it should have features for lead management, contact management, sales management, reporting, forecasting, and analytics. All this will help you track your efforts and monitor your campaigns.

Different departments require CRM to fulfill their distinct purposes; therefore, check whether the CRM meets all your departmental needs.

As your business grows, so do your CRM needs. Hence, it is essential to ensure that the CRM has potential to accommodate your changing business requirements.

- Check whether it integrates with different applications

Check whether it integrates with different applications

The most important feature of a CRM is that it should be capable of integrating with different external applications. Then only you would be able to take advantage of a connected eco-system, integrate your customer journey and streamline your processes.

Your CRM should be such that it can seamlessly integrate with your ERP, Email, social media, website or any software that you are currently using.

- Request a demonstration and test drive

Request a demonstration and test drive

Before selecting the CRM, request a demonstration to have a sales personnel walk you through its features and explain the best use. Take this as an opportunity to ask questions and check if the CRM addresses your most pressing needs.

Further, take a free trial to verify the user interface and layout so your CRM users can make the most of it. You should also check if the system is user-friendly.

Lastly, ask whether uploading your company’s data to the test environment is possible. It will help you evaluate whether the product meets your requirements.

WRAPPING UP-

A CRM can prove beneficial to the success of your business. However, before opting for any CRM, you must ensure that it is a good fit for your organization.

It should be the one that is secure, scalable and give you a good return on investment. You can also look for customer reviews and ratings to help you make an informed decision.

Challenges

1- Difficulty in sorting and organizing ACR records based on roles in account layouts.

2- Users faced inefficiencies due to a static, one-size-fits-all form layout.

3- Account information was not dynamically displayed according to different user roles, causing confusion.

Solutions

1- Implemented dynamic form layouts with customized conditions based on user roles.

2- Developed rules to sort ACR records dynamically based on the account layout.

Results

1- Reduced user navigation time by 40%.

2- Improved user satisfaction by 30%.

3- Increased data accuracy by 25% due to streamlined forms.

The client was struggling with a static form layout on their CRM platform, leading to inefficiencies and errors when accessing account-related information. Users, depending on their roles, were seeing irrelevant data or were unable to quickly find necessary information due to the disorganized account layout. The client needed a solution that would adapt dynamically to different roles, ensuring that only relevant data was presented based on specific criteria.

We implemented a customized solution by designing dynamic form layouts that changed depending on the user’s role. By creating specific rules to sort ACR records, we ensured that each role would have a tailored view of the account layout. This adjustment allowed the platform to adapt and display relevant information only, optimizing user experience and operational efficiency.

- The inefficiencies and confusion around data led to frustration, reducing user satisfaction and adoption of the CRM platform.

- We implemented dynamic form layouts that adjusted to the user's role within the organization. Each role had customized fields and data relevant to their specific tasks.

- We introduced automated rules that sorted ACR records based on roles, reducing the need for manual adjustments and speeding up the process of finding relevant information.

- By developing conditions to display only the necessary data based on the user’s role, we ensured users were not overwhelmed with unnecessary information.

- We provided comprehensive training for all users on the new features, ensuring smooth adoption and effective use of the platform.

We find their weekly meetings to be a valuable tool, they are consistent interactive meetings where we can discuss new implementations and revise changes to any projects that we are in midst of. The team that we were assigned at Tech Mindz is easy to communicate with, and breaks down our communication into bullet points, so we can track progress. We are looking forward to continued growth and organization within salesforce as we continue to work with Tech Mindz.

Dassy Fishman

Technology Mindz continues to be a valuable IT partner for us. We engage them in consultative advice, delivery and execution of IT initiatives, software development, as well as future discussions involving things like AI strategies. Their attention to detail, focused delivery, and prompt communication have been very refreshing. It has been great to have such a diverse IT partner in our circle of resources.

Challenges

1- Identifying incorrect data in the web-to-case form was time-consuming and prone to human errors.

2- Manual allocation of resources for data correction led to delays and inefficiencies.

3- Lack of standardized data entry cluttered the system, making analysis difficult.

Solutions

1- Implemented Apex classes and triggers to enforce data accuracy rules.

2- Introduced automated task creation for flagged validation errors.

3- Applied validation rules for name formatting and phone number standardization.

Results

1- 45% Reduction in manual data validation efforts.

2- 35% Improvement in data accuracy and consistency.

3- 30% Cost Savings due to automation and optimized resource allocation.

The organization faced significant challenges in maintaining clean and standardized data within their Salesforce environment. The manual process of identifying and correcting erroneous data in the web-to-case form consumed valuable time, leading to inefficiencies and increased operational costs. Additionally, the lack of visibility into task completion rates made it difficult to track progress and ensure timely follow-ups on data validation issues.

We developed and deployed a comprehensive automated data validation solution within Salesforce. By leveraging custom Apex classes, triggers, and validation rules, we ensured that data entries met predefined standards. Automated task creation for flagged validation errors enabled seamless tracking and resolution, reducing manual intervention. Furthermore, real-time monitoring tools provided visibility into validation errors and task progress, enhancing overall operational efficiency.

2- Struggles with organizing files of various formats efficiently.

3- Time-consuming process of downloading bulk files in a single zip file format.

Businesses using Salesforce face challenges when trying to download multiple files at once. The process is time-consuming, especially when dealing with various file formats, and makes it difficult for users to locate and organize necessary documents quickly. They require a solution that allows for faster downloads, easier file organization, and better management of resources.

We developed a comprehensive Download Manager app tailored for Salesforce Lightning users. This app allows users to download multiple files in bulk, sort files automatically by format, and manage them with greater ease. With the integrated search functionality, finding specific documents has never been easier. Users can now download and organize resources in zip file format quickly and efficiently, saving valuable time and enhancing productivity.

Challenges

1- Lead data was not recorded in Salesforce, limiting visibility.

2- Duplicate records were created in Microsoft Azure due to multiple storage tables.

3- Lead data was scattered across different tables based on status, making retrieval complex.

Solutions

1- Integrated Microsoft Azure with Salesforce.

2- Mapped fields between Azure and Salesforce lead objects.

3- Used Salesforce Bulk API to batch-process data from Azure to Salesforce.

Results

1- 100% data synchronization between Azure and Salesforce.

2- 40% reduction in data redundancy.

3- 60% faster decision-making with unified insights.

The client was looking for a technology partner who would help them with seamless integration of Microsoft Azure and Salesforce. The leads were getting recorded in the Azure database, but the client wanted it to be also recorded in Salesforce to enhance their convenience. They didn’t want to leave Microsoft Azure since it was doing deduplication of leads and was also performing data nurturing/enrichment.

We developed a structured integration solution to connect Microsoft Azure with Salesforce, ensuring lead data was accurately mapped, transferred, and synchronized between both systems. Our team implemented a batch data processing approach using Salesforce Bulk API, automating lead synchronization every six hours. This helped the client eliminate duplicate records, consolidate lead information, and gain a comprehensive view of their prospects.

4- 35% increase in customer satisfaction due to faster query resolutions.

The client sought to migrate their customer service platform from FogBugz to Salesforce to consolidate their data into a unified platform accessible by multiple teams, including Sales, Service Delivery, Finance, and Executives. They also needed an efficient customer ticket management system to streamline ticket creation, tracking, and reporting.

Technology Mindz facilitated the transition by implementing Salesforce Service Cloud. We developed a centralized system for seamless data access across teams, migrated all customer service data from FogBugz to Salesforce, and created a comprehensive customer trouble management system. The solution also included automated customer communication tools and advanced security features to control user access.

The Solutions

The Results

- Different platforms were used across departments, making it difficult to share information and collaborate efficiently.

- Migrating data and processes from FogBugz to Salesforce presented integration and data consistency challenges.

- Customer queries were managed manually, which led to slow responses and dissatisfaction.

- Creating and managing customer inquiries was cumbersome without a centralized system.

- The process of generating reports for customer tickets was inefficient, causing delays in decision-making.

- We designed a \"single pane of glass\" structure, allowing all relevant teams (Sales, Service Delivery, Finance, and Executives) to access customer information in one place.

- The migration from FogBugz to Salesforce was carefully executed to ensure minimal disruption and data integrity.

- We created an efficient system for managing, creating, and tracking customer service tickets, automating responses to improve service delivery.

- Implemented a closed-sharing model with custom user access controls, giving the Salesforce administrator full authority over user permissions.

- We added email and web-to-case integrations for easy communication and case tracking, improving the customer experience.

Additionally, they needed visibility into their sales representatives’ activities, but Salesforce Professional Edition’s limitations restricted automation, reporting, and data management.

Challenges

- Salesforce codes at some places were not written as per the coding standards.- As per SFDC (Salesforce.com), process builders were not moved to flows.- The existing codebase lacked proper documentation and structure.

Solutions

- Conducted a thorough assessment of the existing codebase.- Refactored and optimized the logic to reduce redundant logics.- Migrated the process builders to flows using identifiers.

3- 25% increase in campaign ROI due to better call tracking.

4- Real-time calling data now available within Salesforce.

The client sought to leverage CallRail’s call tracking capabilities by integrating call data seamlessly into Salesforce. Their primary goal was to gain deeper insights into customer interactions, optimize marketing campaigns, and improve lead management based on real-time call analytics. However, without an integrated system, tracking call-driven leads and associating them with marketing efforts was cumbersome and inefficient.

We successfully integrated CallRail with Salesforce, enabling real-time synchronization of call data. This provided the client with a unified view of call analytics directly within their CRM, allowing for better lead tracking, automated workflows, and improved marketing performance measurement. Custom reporting dashboards were also set up to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Challenges

1- Manual lead entry from multiple sources, resulting in data fragmentation.

2- Errors and delays in lead conversion due to manual contract processing.

3- Lack of a streamlined system for managing lead status and sources.

Solutions

1- Integrated DocuSign with Salesforce for seamless contract management.

2- Automated lead capture from website and other channels into Salesforce.

3- Created a structured framework to categorize leads by type (students, apprentices, employers).

1- Saved significant time, allowing staff to focus on critical tasks.

2- Increased lead conversion efficiency by 40% through automation.

3- Reduced data entry errors by 30%, improving overall productivity.

4- Streamlined contract signing, cutting down processing time by 50%.

The client was struggling with manual lead data entry from multiple sources, which led to fragmented data and inefficient workflows. They also needed a way to send contracts electronically, as the manual contract signing process was time-consuming and prone to errors. Their goal was to automate these processes to improve efficiency and speed up lead conversion.

We integrated DocuSign with Salesforce to enable automated contract sending and signing, eliminating the manual effort of managing and sending contracts. Additionally, we created a framework to capture leads directly from various sources and categorize them into specific types (students, apprentices, and employers) for more efficient management. This allowed the client to streamline their lead management and contract conversion processes, saving both time and resources.

The Results

- The client was receiving leads from multiple channels, which resulted in numerous spreadsheets that needed to be manually maintained. This led to fragmentation of data, making it difficult to track and manage leads effectively.

- The process of sending contracts manually to leads for conversion was both time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays and inaccuracies in lead conversion.

- The client struggled to categorize and track the status of leads efficiently. Leads were not segmented properly into types (students, apprentices, or employers), which created confusion and difficulty in managing them.

- We integrated DocuSign with Salesforce, enabling the client to send, track, and obtain electronic signatures for contracts directly from Salesforce. This eliminated the need for manual contract processing, reducing errors and accelerating the lead conversion process.

- We implemented the Web-to-Lead feature, capturing leads directly from the client’s website and other external sources. These leads were automatically entered into Salesforce, eliminating the manual process of inputting data from Excel spreadsheets.

- We created a framework to categorize leads into three distinct record types: students, apprentices, and employers. This segmentation allowed the client to manage and prioritize leads based on their specific categories, improving lead organization and tracking.

- We developed a flow to automate the process of sending contracts based on complex business scenarios. This flow ensured that contracts were sent quickly and accurately, reducing delays and streamlining the contract signing process.

Automation of the lead entry and contract signing processes saved the client significant time. Staff were no longer burdened with manual data entry or sending contracts manually, allowing them to focus on more critical tasks.

With DocuSign integrated into Salesforce, the client experienced a 50% reduction in contract processing time. The ability to send, track, and sign contracts electronically led to quicker turnaround times and fewer delays in closing deals.

technologymindzanushka

Our client, a national nonprofit organization committed to providing community-based transportation services for senior adults and individuals with visual impairments, sought to improve nationwide access to reliable mobility options. They faced challenges with decentralized, manual data collection from over 500 websites, which was inefficient, inconsistent, and unscalable—especially with more than 40,000 service queries and the need for detailed, structured data. We addressed this by building an AI-powered, cloud-integrated web crawler framework that automated service discovery, structured data extraction, and scalable storage—using technologies like headless browsing, OpenAI, and Azure cloud infrastructure.

Are you getting best ROI out of your Salesforce investment?

When it comes to business, it’s important to get the most out of your investments. To do better than usual, companies adopt new technologies. Although these investments can be expensive, the hope is to get the best value. Even if everything is done right, you might still feel like you’re not getting the full benefit from the investment.

Salesforce is an advanced CRM application that can significantly increase growth rates. Despite all the features Salesforce has to offer, you may find it challenging to determine how to get the most out of it. Are you considering Salesforce as not being an ideal fit for your business? Are you constantly asking, Am I obtaining the highest return on investment from my Salesforce investment? There may be a number of factors impeding your progress. However, Technology Mindz has all the answers you are looking for.

Before we discuss how we can help you get the most out of Salesforce, let’s establish a few KPIs that will help you determine if your investment is paying for itself. They are as follows:

- Profitability

- Cost optimization

- Sales cycle efficiency

- Increased revenue flow

- Cost of lead; number of leads generated and converted, and

- Customer satisfaction

Technology Mindz can assist you in improving these KPIs and thereby increasing your ROI. Here is what we can do for you:

Customization

We are sincerely concerned with your company’s requirements. To properly leverage Salesforce’s functionality, you need a custom-developed solution that meets your goal while reducing costs by removing unnecessary tools.

As a result, you only pay for the features that you need for your business. This saves costs, which accelerates your ROI and productivity.

Automation

There are a myriad of applications available on Salesforce and AppExchange that provide a wide variety of automation capabilities for your regular chores.

With the aid of Salesforce’s different add-ons and built-in capabilities, you can automate most of the sales process. Instead of housekeeping and time-consuming activities, your sales force can concentrate on meeting goals. Thus, manual tasks such as spreadsheet creation, computation, downloading various data, sorting different files, optimizing business processes, and so on can all be done through Salesforce, and we can assist you in integrating these automations into your workflow.

As a result, it enhances the quality of work generated while saving time, so increasing the efficiency of your sales cycle.

Customer experience

With Salesforce, you can analyze your customers’ purchasing histories and experiences to better understand their trends. Understanding your consumer is crucial, and we provide solutions that can assist you in providing a personalized experience to your clients.

This is an excellent method of connecting with your consumers since they will begin to trust and understand you more. Developing this reliance will aid you in retaining current consumers while generating and converting new ones. This results in greater profitability, revenue flow, and optimized economic flows.

Data analytics and forecasting

Better analytics and reporting are obtained when all of your essential company information is saved and managed in one location. With complete visibility into your client data, you can sell faster, service quicker, and promote more effectively. Unfortunately, the vast majority of data provided to organizations is underused and unanalyzed.

Businesses are constantly acquiring data, but the majority of them are failing to use it and get value from it because the data hasn’t been personalized to their team’s specific needs or isn’t easily available in one location. We assist you in ensuring that all Salesforce data is available in a centralized location and is relevant to all teams. Advanced technologies aid in precise forecasting, allowing you to produce outstanding results delivering a great ROI.

Training and collaboration

When teams work together, amazing things happen. Consider us an extension of your team. We assist with Salesforce training and user management, allowing your employees to work better without having to worry about the platform’s intricacies.

Salesforce is always releasing new updates and features, therefore we are ready 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist and guide you through any challenges you may encounter. This saves time since we don’t let you get stuck on such issues, allowing you to focus your precious time on more important matters.

Building And Construction

Challenges

1- Manual and time-consuming invoice aging calculation.

2- Lack of visibility into unpaid bills.

3- No real-time notifications for overdue invoices.

Solutions

1- Automated invoice aging calculation.

2- Implemented real-time alerts for overdue invoices.

3- Introduced visual flags based on invoice aging.

Results

1- 60% improvement in identifying unpaid bills.

2- 40% reduction in overdue payments.

3- 50% faster invoice processing time.

The client struggled to track overdue invoices and lacked visibility into unpaid bills. They needed an automated system to calculate invoice aging, track overdue payments, and provide real-time notifications. Additionally, they wanted a way to dynamically update invoice statuses and alert stakeholders about aging invoices.

We automated the invoice aging process by integrating a dynamic system that recalculates aging based on key dates. We also implemented color-coded visual flags and a real-time notification system to alert stakeholders when invoices became overdue. This streamlined their invoice tracking and improved financial management.

The Results

- The client manually calculated invoice aging, making the process inefficient and error-prone.

- They struggled to manage a high volume of unpaid invoices, lacking clear visibility into outstanding payments.

- Without a real-time alert system, overdue invoices often went unnoticed, delaying financial actions.

- Managing multiple invoices tied to a single opportunity was complex and time-consuming.

- The client had no system to dynamically recalculate invoice aging when an \"Invoice Restart Date\" was set.

- Implemented an automated process to calculate invoice aging based on the \"Invoice Send Date\" field. When an \"Invoice Restart Date\" was provided, the system recalculated aging accordingly.

- Developed a custom Apex solution to compare aging values across multiple invoices related to a single opportunity and update the opportunity’s aging field with the highest value.

- Established an automated alert system to notify stakeholders when invoices exceeded predefined due dates, ensuring timely action.

- Introduced color-coded flags indicating overdue invoices—orange for invoices overdue by more than 60 days and red for invoices overdue by more than 90 days—allowing for quick identification of delinquent accounts.

- Inability to manage recurring donations effectively at one place.- Difficulties in making alterations to the donations records in the opportunity object.- Lack of customizations and availability of limited fields to record data in the opportunity object.

Solutions

Results

- Client was able to manage data with ease at one place.- Better relationships with donors.- Increased efficiency since the details of funds were managed properly with recurring donation.

The client is a Non-profit organization which serves cancer patients. Donation and relationship with donors is a very important aspect for a non-profit organization. The client was earlier recording data related to donation in opportunity object in Salesforce which was not streamlined and comprehensive. The client was looking for a better alternative to avoid these challenges.

We recommended the client to use recurring donation to record their donations and funds to store all the information at one place and enhance the efficiency. We integrated recurring donation as per the client’s requirements which helped them to maintain all the data at one place and avoid confusions and inaccuracies.

- Customized the fields according to the client’s requirements.

IT staffing has evolved as a new normal for companies worldwide. It gives you leverage to extend your IT team with highly-skilled resources from all over the globe while eliminating the effort and time for hiring and onboarding.

According to the research, nearly 54% of companies worldwide are experiencing shortage of talent. It has almost doubled compared to past decade and is increasing continually. Recruiters in 36 out of 44 countries are finding it difficult to attract skilled talent to their teams.

To deal with the shortage of skilled resources, Technology Mindz provides staff augmentation services to amplify your business capabilities, especially in the IT sector.

IT staff augmentation is an outsourcing model that allows companies to hire highly skilled resources globally. This strategy is used to extend the in-house project team with external resources on a permanent, temporary or short-term basis to fulfill the project on time.  This strategy includes evaluating the in-house team, analyzing the needed resources, and then hiring external resources.

For instance, XYZ company requires a resource for three weeks on an immediate basis, however, is unable to find a suitable and skilled resource. In such scenarios, staff augmentation comes into the picture. It helps you to hire temporary staff from the IT Staffing company as per your needs. The hired resources remain on consulting company’s payroll and you need to pay the hiring fees to the consulting company.

IT Staffing Companydelivers you with all the needed resources at the earliest and gets your job done on time.

The need for quick and efficient digital interactions is continuously growing in today’s fast-paced digital society. To meet this need, companies are adopting DevOps, a dynamic framework that builds a systematic approach towards the entire software journey – development, deployment, administration, and maintenance.

DevOps connects developers and operational teams from code creation to rigorous testing, smooth deployment, and constant monitoring. The integration of these critical components not only accelerates the development of new software features, upgrades and repairs but also ensures alignment with business objectives and end-user value.

This blog aims to delve into the power of Salesforce DevOps and the guiding principles that encourage modern businesses to embrace agile development processes, eventually adding significant value to them.

1- Fragmented and inefficient user experience for external users.

2- Complex process for gathering user needs and requirements.

3- Communication gaps between the company and external stakeholders.

The client faced difficulties in collecting and managing data from external users. The process was manual, slow, and prone to errors. They wanted a seamless way to gather and store user requirements automatically within Salesforce, eliminating the need for Excel-based forms and manual data entry.

We developed a Salesforce Experience site tailored to the needs of their external users. By integrating it with Salesforce CRM, we automated data collection and eliminated manual processes. The Experience site provided a user-friendly interface, allowing customers to submit their requirements easily, while Salesforce ensured efficient data management.

The Solutions

The Results

- External users had a disjointed experience when interacting with the company, as there was no centralized platform for them to submit their needs or track their progress.

- The client’s sales team had to manually process user data. External users would fill out Excel forms, which were then emailed to the sales team. The data was subsequently entered manually into Salesforce, leading to inefficiency and a high potential for errors.

- The existing form submission process lacked flexibility. It did not offer dynamic functionality to adapt to individual users' specific requirements, making the process cumbersome and not user-friendly.

- We designed and built a user-friendly Salesforce Experience site as a centralized portal for external users. This platform allowed users to submit their requirements and track their progress in one place, improving the overall user experience.

- The Experience site was integrated with Salesforce CRM, allowing data collected from the forms to be automatically populated in the Salesforce database. This eliminated the manual entry process, reducing errors and speeding up data processing.

- We created dynamic forms that could adapt to each user’s needs. The forms were tailored to the specific requirements of the users, ensuring that the submitted information was relevant and complete, and enhancing the overall user experience.

80%

Streamlined Data Collection

The automation of form submissions reduced manual effort by 80%, saving significant time and reducing the chance of errors.

40%

Improved User Experience

With a user-friendly interface and multi-language support (English and Japanese), the Experience site enhanced accessibility, improving global reach by 40%.

50%

Increased Efficiency

The approval process was automated, cutting down review times by 50%, enabling quicker decision-making and approvals.

Enhanced Data Management

All submitted data was stored in Salesforce, providing the sales team with easy access to customer requirements and reducing data silos.

Better Collaboration

The site facilitated smoother collaboration between the sales team and external users, improving customer satisfaction and engagement.

3- 50% faster task completion due to role-based customization

4- 70% of users reported improved workflow efficiency

The client required a user-friendly, configurable portal that catered to different user roles while reducing the dependency on administrators for UI changes. Users needed a more efficient, personalized experience that allowed them to streamline tasks and focus on critical activities without navigating irrelevant data.

We implemented a user-based UI configuration system that enabled role-specific dashboards, self-service customization options, and advanced personalization settings. By integrating features like widget-based dashboards, theme customization, and automated role-based layouts, we empowered users to take control of their interface. Additionally, we optimized admin controls to facilitate seamless system-wide updates while maintaining user independence.

The organization lacked a centralized, searchable transportation service database across the United States. Manual data collection from over 500 websites was inefficient, error-prone, and unsustainable—especially with 40,000+ service queries and the need for over 30 structured data points per entry.

We developed a scalable, AI-powered, cloud-integrated web crawler framework. The solution automated data discovery, structured extraction, and storage—leveraging headless scraping, OpenAI for content structuring, search APIs for URL discovery, and Azure for processing and storage scalability.

Technology Mindz takes on a new journey ahead

Technology Mindz has grown and evolved over a decade since it took its first step into the corporate world. The company has progressed simultaneously across several different dimensions and is now a dynamic and diverse organization. With time evolution, the company decided to change its brand identity elements and start a fresh journey with new challenges.

The idea behind visual identity change was to suit the new world order by articulating the transformation of our brand. The all-new visual identity of Technology Mindz reflects our growth aspirations and propels the brand into a new era. While keeping intact the core values that have earned the unequivocal trust of its customers.

Visual Brand Identity Elements

Brand Logo

Our newly designed logo represents three pillars of the company, i.e., Excellence, Innovation, and Performance. It emulates our global outlook, evolving nature of the organization, and progressiveness towards continuous improvement. It is flat and uncluttered, designed to live in movement. Visually, it gives a clean, fresh look and makes the company appear more contemporary and sophisticated. In short, it is a manifestation of what we stand for as we build a par-excellence brand for best-in class customer experience.

The Colour Scheme

Blue\tWhite

HEX\t#053C78\tHEX\t#FFFFFF

RGB\t5, 60, 120\tRGB\t255, 255, 255

Our new colour scheme for the logo is monochrome. The choice of vibrant and ever-visible blue colour signifies technology and knowledge whereas; the pure white colour stands for trust and loyalty. Both the colours represent our brand’s vision.

Challenges

1- Lack of a centralized system for managing recurring donations efficiently.

2- Difficulty in modifying donation records in the opportunity object.

3- Limited customization options and insufficient fields to store necessary data.

Solutions

1- Integrated a recurring donation feature into the client’s Salesforce.

2- Implemented two types of recurring donations: fixed-length and open-ended.

Results

As the number of recurring donors grew, it became increasingly challenging to maintain accurate records, adjust donation amounts, and track donor engagement. They needed a structured and automated system to manage recurring donations seamlessly.

To streamline the donation management process, we recommended and implemented Salesforce’s recurring donation functionality.

This allowed for seamless tracking, better data accuracy, and improved donor engagement.

Salesforce Lightning users often struggle with the inefficient management of files and attachments within their CRM platform. As a result, users need a streamlined solution to organize, search, and access files with ease, especially when dealing with bulk data. This case study highlights a solution designed to address these challenges.

The client needed a reliable, scalable tool to manage files and email attachments in Salesforce. Users were facing challenges in quickly locating specific files and handling large volumes of attachments. Without a quick search function, finding documents required a manual and time-consuming effort. They also needed a feature that could categorize and sort files to make the entire process smoother and more efficient.

We created an app on the Salesforce AppExchange tailored to resolve these file management issues. The app offered a centralized system for organizing and managing files and attachments, ensuring that users could easily search, sort, and access documents based on different parameters like name, date, type, and size. Additionally, we implemented functionality to separate and organize images and documents, enhancing user experience and workflow efficiency.

The Results

- Salesforce users often struggle with managing large volumes of files and attachments, particularly when the CRM contains vast amounts of data. These files are typically scattered across different folders or sections, making it difficult to stay organized.

- A lack of quick search functionality meant that users had to manually sift through files and attachments to locate specific documents. This created inefficiencies, particularly when needing to retrieve information in a timely manner.

- Without a clear categorization system, sorting and organizing files manually was time-consuming. Users spent more time managing documents than focusing on core tasks, leading to productivity losses.

- We developed an app specifically for Salesforce users to manage all their files and attachments in one place. This app was designed to simplify the file management process and eliminate the need for manual organization.

- To address the search functionality issue, we implemented a robust search feature based on key file parameters such as name, date, type, and size. This allowed users to quickly find the documents they needed without having to dig through countless files.

- To further enhance usability, we introduced the ability to sort and separate images and documents. This separation allowed users to access and organize content more efficiently, improving the workflow significantly.

The app provided a centralized location for all files and attachments, significantly improving file management. Users no longer needed to manually search for or organize files, which improved overall system efficiency.

40%

The ability to organize files automatically based on several criteria improved overall workflow efficiency by 40%. Additionally, the separation of images and documents streamlined operations, saving users valuable time.

60%

With the new search functionality, users could locate files in 60% less time compared to manual searches. This reduced delays and enabled quicker decision-making.

IT helpdesks are critical to businesses in today’s hyper-connected world. They are the first point of contact with employees, providing resolutions to their IT problems as quickly and efficiently as possible.

An efficient IT helpdesk is a vital component of organizations, ensuring that employees and users have access to timely and effective technical support. It plays a pivotal role in enhancing IT efficiency, reducing downtime, and facilitating productive use of technology resources throughout the organization.

Business Consulting and Services

Challenges

1- External users had access to internal events.

2- Auditors couldn’t search audits by location or region.

3- Client was paying high monthly subscription fees for an unused third-party calendar.

Solutions

1- Developed a custom Salesforce calendar integrated with audit data.

2- Created distinct views for internal and external users to ensure privacy.

3- Implemented dynamic search functionality for internal users to search by auditor, region, and client.

Results

1- Improved auditor privacy with distinct internal and external views.

2- Saved 30% on third-party calendar subscription fees.

3- Increased auditor convenience and streamlined event searching by 50%.

The client needed a more efficient and customizable calendar solution within Salesforce, with specific functionality to replace their expensive third-party calendar. They were facing challenges with managing auditor availability and maintaining privacy between internal and external users. Additionally, the client needed a way to improve the search and organization of audit events by auditor name, region, and client.

We created a custom Salesforce calendar using the LWC component and JavaScript library, integrating it with their audit data in Salesforce. We developed two distinct views for internal and external auditors to ensure confidentiality and privacy. We also added features to allow external auditors to input their availability and view their scheduled audits, while internal users gained the ability to search events by various criteria. This custom calendar eliminated the need for the third-party solution and streamlined the scheduling process.

Key Pains

The Challenges

The Solutions

The Results

- The client was using a third-party calendar that included numerous unused features, leading to higher subscription costs each month.

- In the existing system, both internal and external auditors had access to the same audit information, compromising confidentiality.

- The existing system lacked the ability to search for audits by specific criteria like auditor name, region, and client name, making it difficult for internal users to find relevant information.

- External auditors could not input their availability or see which audits were scheduled for them, resulting in scheduling conflicts and delays.

- The third-party calendar had no seamless integration with Salesforce, making it difficult to link audit records and events.

- We developed a custom calendar within Salesforce, using the LWC component and JavaScript library, and integrated it with the client's audit data stored in Salesforce.

- To protect sensitive data, we created separate views for internal users (auditors and employees) and external users (partners and clients). Internal users had access to the full set of audits, while external auditors only saw their own scheduled audits.

- We enabled external auditors to input their availability directly into the calendar, allowing them to manage their schedule and avoid conflicts.

- We implemented a dynamic search function that allowed internal users to filter audit events by auditor name, region, and client name, improving the process of locating specific audits.

- We added a feature that allowed internal users to click on any audit event to open a read-only popup with all the necessary details, such as auditor name, hours, start and end date, and more.

Improved Auditor Privacy

The distinct views for internal and external auditors ensured that sensitive audit information remained confidential. This helped safeguard privacy and mitigate potential data breaches. The privacy features were highly praised by both internal and external users.

30%

Cost Savings

By eliminating the need for a third-party calendar, the client saved approximately 30% on their monthly subscription fees, which were previously spent on unnecessary features in the external calendar.

Increased Convenience for Auditors

Auditors were now able to view all the details of their respective audits, leading to a significant increase in convenience. External auditors could now update their availability, leading to fewer scheduling delays.

50%

Streamlined Event Search

Internal users reported a 50% improvement in the time it took to find specific audits, thanks to the new search functionality by auditor name, region, and client.

Enhanced Data Integration

The seamless integration with Salesforce allowed the client to easily create and manage audit records within the same platform, eliminating inefficiencies caused by working with a disconnected system.

Challenges

- Fragmented communication between Telegram and Salesforce.- Manual case management process.- Lack of visibility into customer interactions on Telegram.

Solutions

- Integrated Telegram with Salesforce using Telegram API.- Implemented a Telegram bot for automated responses.- Created custom Salesforce objects for better tracking and case management.

Results

- 90% improvement in response times.- 75% boost in team productivity by reducing manual tasks.- 40% increase in customer satisfaction due to faster resolutions.

The client’s sales team previously communicated with customers and coordinated with product specialists using the Telegram app, manually adding them to group chats. They faced inefficiencies in managing these interactions, as Telegram was not integrated with their Salesforce system. The client wanted a way to automate customer interactions, track Telegram data, and centralize communication for better case management and improved customer service.

Technology Mindz integrated Telegram with Salesforce using the Telegram API, creating a unified platform for communication. We implemented a Telegram bot to automate responses and reduced manual tasks. Additionally, we built custom Salesforce objects to track Telegram data, including participants, messages, and cases, streamlining the entire customer support process.

The Challenges

The Solutions

The Results

- Telegram was being used separately from Salesforce, making it difficult to track and manage customer interactions effectively. Conversations were not centralized, which led to inefficiencies and communication gaps between teams.

- The client lacked an automated system for managing cases raised by customers on Telegram. Sales and support teams had to manually log and track these cases, which was time-consuming and resulted in slow response times.

- Without an integrated solution, product specialists had to be manually added to group chats, consuming valuable time. This manual process not only delayed response times but also led to a lack of consistency in managing customer inquiries.

- The lack of integration meant that valuable customer interaction data from Telegram could not be captured or analyzed within Salesforce. This prevented the client from leveraging insights to improve customer service or track key performance metrics.

- We integrated Telegram with Salesforce using the Telegram API, centralizing communication and enabling the sales and support teams to manage all customer interactions from within Salesforce. This eliminated the fragmentation between systems.

- To efficiently track and manage customer interactions, we created three custom Salesforce objects- Participants: To track users in the conversation, Telegram Chat Messages: To capture both inbound and outbound messages, Telegram Chat Cases: To manage and resolve customer cases raised through Telegram.

- We introduced a Telegram bot, which acted as a dummy account for product specialists. This bot was linked to Salesforce as a user, allowing product specialists to be automatically included in the conversations without manual intervention, saving time and reducing the workload on support teams.

- We also developed a Lightning Web Component (LWC) within Salesforce that mirrored the Telegram official app’s UI, making the interface familiar and intuitive for the users. This seamless integration improved user adoption of Salesforce and simplified communication with customers.

90%

Faster Response Times

By automating the communication process with the Telegram bot and integrating it with Salesforce, the client was able to reduce the time spent on manual case management. This resulted in a 90% improvement in response times, enabling quicker resolutions for customer queries.

75%

Increase in Productivity

The integration of Telegram with Salesforce allowed the sales and support teams to automate routine tasks, reducing the need for manual effort. This led to a 75% boost in team productivity, as teams could now focus on higher-value tasks instead of repetitive work.

40%

Increase in Customer Satisfaction

The enhanced communication efficiency and faster response times led to a 40% improvement in customer satisfaction. Customers appreciated the quick and automated responses, contributing to a more positive experience and fostering loyalty.

Improved Case Management

With custom objects and streamlined tracking, all Telegram interactions were logged and managed in Salesforce. This increased visibility into customer cases and improved the overall case resolution process, ensuring a better-organized workflow for the support team.

Last updated on February 11, 2025

Security breaches have become an ever-present hazard in the comprehensive digital ecosystem, where organizations and individuals rely significantly on technology. To combat this, organizations must stay one step ahead of cybercriminals in order to preserve sensitive information and maintain the integrity of their digital assets. This is where penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, comes into play as a critical component of a robust cybersecurity strategy.

What is Penetration testing?

Penetration testing, also known as pen-testing, is a systematic approach to assessing an organization’s cybersecurity. It entails simulating a real-world attack on an organization’s network, systems, and applications in order to exploit flaws and possible vulnerabilities. This allows organizations to patch these vulnerabilities before hackers exploit them.Following the test, the penetration testing team creates a thorough report detailing the vulnerabilities found in the target system as well as recommendations for fixing them.

Why is Penetration Testing Important for Businesses?

Penetration testing is the most effective way to ensure that your organization’s data is safe, with no neglected vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access to your data. The following are the primary reasons why penetration testing is critical for businesses:

1. To identify exploitable weaknesses:A penetration test can assist in identifying gaps in security and vulnerabilities that can be exploited and must be addressed in order to prevent data breaches in your organization.

2.To measure the impact on business:Penetration testing can assist you in calculating the monetary cost in the event of a cyberattack on your business. Thus, knowing beforehand, you can fix the issues that can help reduce potential financial losses and operational interruptions in the future.

To measure the impact on business:Penetration testing can assist you in calculating the monetary cost in the event of a cyberattack on your business. Thus, knowing beforehand, you can fix the issues that can help reduce potential financial losses and operational interruptions in the future.

3.To assess the effectiveness of remediation:The test may also be used to assess the effectiveness of current security solutions handled by your IT staff following a prior cyberattack.

4.To meet compliance and regulation:Penetration testing aids in fulfilling your organization’s compliance obligations, allowing you to avoid potential penalties arising from non-security compliance.

5. To protect the company’s reputation:A data breach may devastate an organization’s reputation, causing consumers and partners to lose confidence and credibility. Regular penetration testing assures you and your stakeholders that the data is in safe hands.

Conclusion

Penetration testing is essential for every organization in an era where cyber-attacks are becoming more frequent. Investing in preventative security measures, like penetration testing, is a proactive step towards reducing risks and decreasing the effect of possible breaches.AtTechnology Mindz, we recognize the crucial need to protect your digital assets and sensitive information. Thus, we offer cutting-edge penetration testing services to help you strengthen your cybersecurity posture.

Today's businesses face a number of security challenges, including outdated security solutions, sophisticated cyberthreats, and increasing compliance requirements. In order to stay ahead of the curve, organizations need a proactive partner who can anticipate and neutralize threats before they materialize. At Technology Mindz, we understand that security is not just a defensive measure; it is a catalyst for driving business innovation, transformation, and growth.

Our team of experts brings together deep industry knowledge and cutting-edge technologies to deliver tailored security solutions that align with your unique needs and challenges. We offer a wide range of services to help businesses of all sizes protect themselves from cyber threats.

Modern Cybersecurity with end-to-end threat and vulnerability management

Our dedicated team provides you with the visibility you need to succeed in your business. By unifying security data, you can confidently navigate, identifying data at risk and vulnerabilities across networks on thousands of endpoints, between clouds, and countering today’s advanced attacks by cybercriminals.

Advanced protection with our vulnerability assessment and penetration testing

Our team helps protect your organization by providing visibility into security vulnerabilities and guidance on how to remediate them. VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing) is increasingly important to ensure compliance with standards such as GDPR, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS. We offer a comprehensive VAPT service that includes vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and red team operations. These services uncover infrastructure vulnerabilities and errors that could lead to cyber-attacks. Our approach provides a more detailed view of the threats facing your applications, enabling your business to protect its systems and data from malicious attacks.

Phishing campaign and threat simulation

Our team specializes in conducting phishing simulation campaigns to assess user awareness and sensitivity towards various types of phishing attacks. By engaging in these campaigns, we help you gain valuable insights into your organization’s risk behavior, enabling you to evaluate overall risk levels across different user groups. An optimal phishing simulation strategy and our expert-curated phishing training motivate users to report suspected phishing emails, allowing you to transform your employees into active defenders.

Prioritization

We effectively manage the large number of alerts that come in and carefully analyze each one. By adding context to the analysis, we can determine which alerts are harmless and which ones indicate malicious activity.

Threat hunting and detection

We combine technology with our understanding of attacker behavior to monitor and detect network threats that automated systems often miss.

Analysis and investigation

We conduct thorough investigations of attacks and provide valuable context to help you gain a deeper understanding of them. This knowledge can be leveraged to strengthen your overall security strategy.

Response

We will notify you of critical threats and deliver a comprehensive root-cause analysis. In addition, we will provide actionable advice on the most effective steps to take for a swift recovery.

Remediation

We work tirelessly to restore systems by removing intruders, malware, and persistence mechanisms.

Compliance management

We specialize in setting up, enhancing, and managing an effective regulatory compliance management ecosystem to handle multiple regulatory requirements specific to industries and geographies within your organization.

Governance and risk management

We excel in building and enhancing IT governance and enterprise risk management processes, along with developing strategies and roadmaps for effective policy management, operations, and regulatory risk management.

OT and IT risk and maturity assessment

We strive to understand the areas where your technology, processes, and people may be exposed. By doing so, we can identify the necessary technical, administrative, and physical controls that need to be implemented to minimize the likelihood and consequences of cyber attacks.

Technology Mindz offers a comprehensive IT security approach that provides a holistic perspective to identify advanced threats, suspicious user activity, policy violations, and associated risks to your organization’s valuable data.

The utilization of desktops, laptops, servers, firewalls, routers, switches, and other technologies in today’s business landscape generates a significant volume of data points that remain vulnerable to persistent security threats. This reliance on technology exposes your company to various risks, including revenue loss, reputational damage, compliance fines, and a potential competitive disadvantage.

What our customers are saying about us?

We had a challenge connecting Salesforce with our external data and needed a partner with the technical acumen to accomplish this goal. The Technology Mindz team was able to understand our requirements and give us exactly what we needed. We are going to save tons of time having this functionality available and now we have a reliable partner that we trust to help us grow our business.

Joel Wean

Technology Mindz was a great partner for us to help redesign our salesforce environment. We could not use our current Salesforce environment to support our business processes or sales or contract management processes. Technology Mindz has helped us change the Salesforce configuration to support our business process and customer engagement.

Dustin Fennell

Technology Mindz come our rescue with our Salesforce Org! Technology Mindz was able to provide the proper assistance when I could not get help from Salesforce Technical Support and were extremely intelligent. Every meeting brought us closer to finishing our requests, and every time we talked, announced that the request had been completed and the coding had been fixed.

Sara Hernandez

Global Agricultural company

Working with Tech Mindz has been beneficial for our company. We find their weekly meetings to be a valuable tool, they are consistent interactive meetings where we can discuss new implementations and revise changes to any projects that we are in midst of. The team that we were assigned at Tech Mindz is easy to communicate with, and breaks down our communication into bullet points, so we can track progress. We are looking forward to continued growth and organization within salesforce as we continue to work with Tech Mindz.

Dassy Fishman

Technology Mindz continues to be a valuable IT partner for us. We engage them in consultative advice, delivery and execution of IT initiatives, software development, as well as future discussions involving things like AI strategies. Their attention to detail, focused delivery, and prompt communication have been very refreshing. It has been great to have such a diverse IT partner in our circle of resources. I would highly recommend them.

technologymindzanushka

Our client, a national nonprofit organization committed to providing community-based transportation services for senior adults and individuals with visual impairments, sought to improve nationwide access to reliable mobility options. They faced challenges with decentralized, manual data collection from over 500 websites, which was inefficient, inconsistent, and unscalable—especially with more than 40,000 service queries and the need for detailed, structured data. We addressed this by building an AI-powered, cloud-integrated web crawler framework that automated service discovery, structured data extraction, and scalable storage—using technologies like headless browsing, OpenAI, and Azure cloud infrastructure.

We are looking forward to continued growth and organization within salesforce as we continue to work with Tech Mindz.

We engage them in consultative advice, delivery and execution of IT initiatives, software development, as well as future discussions involving things like AI strategies.

4- Reduced unnecessary email automation, enhancing manual functionality by 50%.

The client was facing several pain points in their Salesforce Sales Cloud implementation, including performance issues, errors in QuickBooks integration, and inefficiencies caused by unused plugins and automation processes. They also required the migration of existing automation to Salesforce Flows to streamline operations and improve system performance. Additionally, there was a need to stop certain email automations and offer manual control over some processes.

We configured the QuickBooks integration to fix error messages and ensure smooth data flow between systems. Our team also conducted an analysis of the Salesforce org to identify and remove unused plugins and managed packages, boosting performance. We migrated automation processes from Process Builders, Workflows, and Triggers to Flows, allowing for better process management and improved efficiency. Additionally, we stopped the undesired email automation and provided manual functionality where needed.

The Results

- The client’s Salesforce org was facing performance degradation due to the installation of numerous unused plugins and managed packages. This caused slow loading times and reduced overall system efficiency.

- Data discrepancies were affecting the integration with QuickBooks, resulting in technical error messages that disrupted workflows and led to inconsistent data, particularly in accounting and reporting.

- The client had email automation running for several services that were no longer needed. These automated emails created unnecessary work and confusion, and the client needed the flexibility to switch to manual controls for certain processes.

- Our team reconfigured the QuickBooks integration to resolve the error messages caused by data discrepancies. This eliminated the inconvenience and ensured smooth, error-free transactions between Salesforce and QuickBooks.

- We conducted a detailed analysis of all installed plugins and managed packages, removing those that were no longer in use. We ensured the removal process was done carefully, considering the impact of dependencies, and as a result, system performance improved significantly.

- A comprehensive review of the automation processes was done, with a focus on migrating from Process Builders, Workflows, and Triggers to Flows. This transition was executed smoothly, without interrupting the client’s business workflows, modernizing automation, and improving efficiency.

technologymindzanushka

Our client, a national nonprofit organization committed to providing community-based transportation services for senior adults and individuals with visual impairments, sought to improve nationwide access to reliable mobility options. They faced challenges with decentralized, manual data collection from over 500 websites, which was inefficient, inconsistent, and unscalable—especially with more than 40,000 service queries and the need for detailed, structured data. We addressed this by building an AI-powered, cloud-integrated web crawler framework that automated service discovery, structured data extraction, and scalable storage—using technologies like headless browsing, OpenAI, and Azure cloud infrastructure.

Manual processing of online form submissions resulted in delays, data errors, and inconsistent follow-ups. The client required a scalable and intelligent automation system to streamline lead creation, apply logic for special cases, avoid duplicates, trigger multi-channel alerts, and integrate seamlessly with both Salesforce and internal tools like Slack and Google Calendar.

We designed an advanced Zapier automation suite connecting Webflow, Salesforce, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Slack. The workflow includes form intake, duplicate detection, conditional branching for lead qualification, task creation with due dates, auto-calendar events, Slack/email alerts, and fallback logic to ensure no inquiry is dropped. Salesforce was enhanced with custom metadata and logic handlers to sync seamlessly with the automation flow.

Challenges

1- Lack of security and checks on employee access to systems.

2- Unorganized and inefficient IT infrastructure management.

3- Absence of a structured Helpdesk system for issue tracking.

Solutions

1- Implemented strict security protocols for authorized network access.

2- Deployed Endpoint Central for remote access and security.

3- Set up a centralized ticket management system to track IT issues.

With business growth, the client needed a more reliable and secure IT infrastructure to support their expanding operations. Their existing vendor was unable to meet the growing demands, and they required a Helpdesk system for better management of IT issues. They needed enhanced system security and a structured approach to IT infrastructure to ensure scalability.

We analyzed the client’s existing IT infrastructure and implemented an end-to-end solution. This included setting up a Helpdesk system, deploying Endpoint Central for remote access and security, and establishing security policies for better access control. We ensured 24/7 support through our skilled IT team, which provided proactive maintenance and management of hardware, software, and network services.

The Results

- The client’s IT infrastructure was inefficient and lacked proper management. This resulted in system downtime and difficulty scaling operations to meet growing business needs.

- Without checks on system access, unauthorized users had the potential to compromise network security, putting sensitive data at risk.

- Issues were raised through emails, causing delays and inefficiencies in IT support. The absence of a Helpdesk system meant no central repository to track and manage cases.

- There was no database for tracking systems, warranties, or other critical asset information, leading to missed opportunities for optimization.

- The client had purchased software but was not fully utilizing their capabilities, resulting in wasted resources and untapped potential.

- We provided round-the-clock managed IT services, ensuring that hardware, software, and network systems were constantly monitored and maintained by our team of experts.

- We installed Endpoint Central for efficient patch management and remote access. Additionally, we conducted a threat analysis and implemented Sophos for endpoint security, reducing exposure to cyber threats.

- We introduced ServiceDesk to create a seamless ticketing system, allowing employees to report issues easily. Even when issues were raised via email, they were automatically converted into tickets for tracking and resolution.

- We implemented security policies, restricting unauthorized access to the network. A centralized database was created to track all users and systems, ensuring only authorized devices could connect.

- We optimized the client’s IT systems, eliminating inefficiencies, and reducing complexity to ensure smooth operations across the business.

We had a challenge connecting Salesforce with our external data and needed a partner with the technical acumen to accomplish this goal. The Technology Mindz team was able to understand our requirements and give us exactly what we needed. We are going to save tons of time having this functionality available and now we have a reliable partner that we trust to help us grow our business.

Joel Wean

Technology Mindz was a great partner for us to help redesign our salesforce environment. We could not use our current Salesforce environment to support our business processes or sales or contract management processes. Technology Mindz has helped us change the Salesforce configuration to support our business process and customer engagement.

Dustin Fennell

Technology Mindz come our rescue with our Salesforce Org! Technology Mindz was able to provide the proper assistance when I could not get help from Salesforce Technical Support and were extremely intelligent. Every meeting brought us closer to finishing our requests, and every time we talked, announced that the request had been completed and the coding had been fixed.

Sara Hernandez

After one year of working with Technology Mindz, the experience has been excellent both in the implementation of Salesforce sales cloud and Salesforce marketing cloud. They have understood our business needs and suggested and implemented the best for us- a great Team with excellent knowledge.

Global Agricultural company

Working with Tech Mindz has been beneficial for our company. We find their weekly meetings to be a valuable tool, they are consistent interactive meetings where we can discuss new implementations and revise changes to any projects that we are in midst of. The team that we were assigned at Tech Mindz is easy to communicate with, and breaks down our communication into bullet points, so we can track progress. We are looking forward to continued growth and organization within salesforce as we continue to work with Tech Mindz.

Dassy Fishman

Technology Mindz continues to be a valuable IT partner for us. We engage them in consultative advice, delivery and execution of IT initiatives, software development, as well as future discussions involving things like AI strategies. Their attention to detail, focused delivery, and prompt communication have been very refreshing. It has been great to have such a diverse IT partner in our circle of resources.

Challenges

1- Inefficient and siloed systems leading to delays in patient care and communication gaps.

2- Inconsistent data across multiple departments, resulting in errors and a lack of coordination.

3- Difficulty in managing patient information, treatment history, and communication effectively.

4- Lack of integration between patient care, billing, and administrative teams.

Solutions

1- Reimplemented Salesforce for better integration and streamlined data management.

2- Customized workflows to improve patient journey tracking from appointment scheduling to treatment.

3- Implemented automated reminders and notifications to improve communication between departments.

4- Integrated billing and administrative systems with patient care data for smoother operations.

Results

1- 30% improvement in patient care efficiency.

2- 20% reduction in administrative errors due to better data integration.

3- 25% reduction in appointment scheduling delays.

4- 15% increase in patient satisfaction scores following streamlined communication.

The client needed to improve their internal operations by streamlining their data management systems. Their existing CRM and healthcare management systems were siloed, resulting in inefficient workflows, miscommunication between departments, and an inability to manage patient data in a unified manner. This was leading to delays in patient care, administrative errors, and a lack of coordination across different hospital units.

We helped the client reimplement Salesforce, customizing it to their unique needs. The solution integrated patient care, administrative tasks, and billing processes, eliminating data silos and automating workflows. This reimplementation provided real-time data sharing between departments, improved patient tracking, and enhanced communication. We also designed automated notifications to remind staff of upcoming appointments, treatments, and follow-ups, ensuring that no critical task was missed.

The Challenges

The Solutions

The Results

- The client was using multiple disparate systems to manage different aspects of patient care, from scheduling to billing. This lack of integration led to data duplication, delays, and errors in patient records.

- The absence of a centralized platform for internal communication meant that staff members across different departments were often unaware of the patient's treatment progress, which resulted in inconsistent care and longer wait times.

- Managing detailed patient information, including medical histories, appointments, and follow-ups, was challenging due to lack of proper systems, leading to errors in treatments and care.

- The manual processes involved in billing and scheduling were error-prone and time-consuming, creating a burden on administrative staff and further delaying care.

- We implemented Salesforce, focusing on healthcare-specific needs. Salesforce was integrated with hospital systems to unify patient data and provide a holistic view across all departments.

- Automated workflows were created for patient appointment scheduling, treatment follow-ups, and billing. This allowed for seamless coordination between administrative staff and medical teams.

- By integrating patient care data, appointment history, and billing systems within Salesforce, we eliminated manual entry and reduced the risk of errors.

- We set up automated reminders and notifications for patients and staff to ensure timely follow-ups, treatment plans, and administrative tasks, resulting in improved communication.

Challenges

1- Multiple triggers on a single object causing confusion and inefficiencies.

2- Inaccurate sales tax calculations, leading to financial discrepancies.

3- Slow system performance due to inefficient trigger logic.

Solutions

1- Identified and resolved inefficiencies in trigger logic.

2- Customized tax calculation functionality based on location and tax rates.

3- Refactored code following Salesforce best practices to improve system performance.

Results

1- Reduced system response time by 50%, speeding up order processing.

2- Ensured accurate tax calculations, reducing errors and compliance issues.

3- Streamlined trigger logic, improving performance and reducing downtime.

The client faced challenges in their Salesforce environment, particularly with inaccurate sales tax calculations and inefficient trigger logic. They sought a solution to streamline and optimize trigger processes, improve tax accuracy, and enhance overall system performance.

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of their Salesforce setup, identifying the bottlenecks caused by inefficient triggers. We refactored the trigger logic to follow Salesforce best practices, merging multiple triggers into one, and optimized the tax calculation system to ensure accuracy. This resulted in faster system performance, accurate tax assessments, and streamlined trigger processes.

The Challenges

The Solutions

The Results

- The client struggled with inconsistencies in applying and computing sales tax, particularly due to the varying tax rates across different states. This led to financial discrepancies and customer dissatisfaction, as customers were being charged incorrect tax amounts.

- The existing triggers were not optimized and caused significant performance issues. Multiple triggers were attached to a single object, which led to database contention, long transaction processing times, and overall sluggish system performance.

- The complex and unorganized trigger code made it difficult to maintain and debug. The system was prone to errors, and the lack of a clear structure added unnecessary complexity to resolving issues.

- We identified inefficiencies in the trigger logic and streamlined the process by merging multiple triggers on a single object into one. This reduced confusion, eliminated delays, and made the trigger logic more efficient, readable, and maintainable.

- To address the issue of inaccurate tax calculations, we implemented an automated system that calculated taxes based on the customer’s location and prevailing tax rates. This ensured accuracy and compliance across different states and regions.

- We reorganized the trigger logic using Salesforce best practices, reducing redundant code and optimizing query execution. This not only improved system performance but also made it easier to maintain and debug the triggers in the future.

Improved Accuracy in Tax Calculations

By automating the tax calculation process, the client saw a significant reduction in errors, ensuring accurate tax assessments on all sales orders. This improved compliance and reduced customer disputes.

Enhanced Customer Satisfaction

With more accurate tax calculations, customers faced fewer issues with overcharging or discrepancies, leading to an increase in customer satisfaction. This also helped the client build trust and maintain stronger relationships with their customers.

Performance Boost

Refactoring the trigger logic resulted in a 50% improvement in system response time. Order processing times were drastically reduced, enhancing the efficiency of sales and inventory management.

Reduced Downtime

The streamlined trigger processes minimized system downtime, improving overall system reliability and stability. This allowed the client to operate more efficiently, without frequent delays or system errors.

Building And Construction

Challenges

1- Data discrepancies between QuickBooks and Salesforce.

2- Inability to generate timely and accurate financial reports.

3- Payment records were not correctly linked to the respective objects in Salesforce.

Solutions

1- Fixed the integration between Salesforce and QuickBooks.

2- Synced payment records in QuickBooks with opportunities in Salesforce.

3- Connected payment records with corresponding invoices in Salesforce.

Results

1- 100% elimination of data discrepancies between systems.

2- 50% reduction in time spent on financial reconciliation.

3- Improved accuracy of financial reporting by 75%.

The client had a pre-built integration between Salesforce and QuickBooks, but it was not functioning correctly. Due to this, financial records were incomplete, causing data discrepancies and inaccuracies in financial reporting. They required an automated system where a payment recorded in QuickBooks would seamlessly generate a corresponding payment record in Salesforce. Additionally, they wanted invoices in Salesforce to be automatically updated with a “Paid” status whenever payments were completed.

We revamped the Salesforce-QuickBooks integration to ensure smooth data synchronization. By fixing the integration logic, automating the payment record creation process, and updating invoice statuses dynamically, we eliminated manual reconciliation efforts. The use of Zapier as a connector was optimized to ensure that payment data flowed accurately between both platforms, allowing for real-time financial visibility.

We identified inefficiencies in their existing system and implemented strategic enhancements. By leveraging Salesforce best practices, we automated key processes, removed redundant customizations, and introduced scalable solutions for financial calculations. This not only optimized their workflow but also improved system reliability, user satisfaction, and long-term maintainability.

4- 35% improvement in team coordination and document accessibility.

Using two separate systems—Salesforce for sales and Alfresco ECM for document storage—was creating inefficiencies. The client needed a centralized solution to streamline sales and document management, eliminate manual efforts, and improve coordination between teams. They sought an integrated system that would save time and enhance productivity, allowing sales personnel to focus on closing deals rather than managing documents.

Technology Mindz developed a bridge web application to integrate Salesforce Sales Cloud with Alfresco ECM. This solution automated document synchronization, reduced manual data entry, and enabled seamless document access within Salesforce. The integration ensured that all sales-related documents—such as proposals, invoices, quotes, and technical documentation—were instantly available in the Sales Cloud, improving efficiency and collaboration.

2- Data inaccuracies affecting business processes.

3- Inability to analyze business insights effectively using the standard dashboard.

Solutions

1- Cleaned up Salesforce org by deleting 30,000 unnecessary accounts.

2- Upgraded to a dynamic dashboard for better real-time insights.

3- Added formula fields for daily updates and percentage analysis in reports.

The client faced challenges with accidental account creation in their Salesforce org, resulting in inaccurate data and hampered business processes. Additionally, their standard dashboards lacked real-time updates and the ability to extract actionable insights, making decision-making difficult. They needed a solution to clean up their Salesforce org and enhance the visibility of key business data.

We undertook a comprehensive analysis of the client’s current Salesforce setup and identified key areas for improvement. We began by deleting over 30,000 unnecessary accounts to streamline their Salesforce org, ensuring more accurate data management. We also converted the client’s standard dashboard into a dynamic dashboard, incorporating formula fields for daily target updates and percentage analysis, providing real-time business insights for enhanced decision-making.

The Solutions

The Results

- The client’s Salesforce org was cluttered with over 30,000 unwanted accounts, accidentally created over time. This data overload caused inaccuracies and made it difficult to manage customer relationships, hindering business processes.

- The presence of unnecessary accounts resulted in misleading data, affecting key business operations such as sales forecasting and resource allocation. Employees were spending valuable time sorting through inaccurate data, which led to inefficiencies.

- The client struggled to extract meaningful insights from their standard dashboard, as it lacked real-time updates and the ability to perform detailed analysis, such as percentage breakdowns of key metrics. This made decision-making slow and less informed.

- We automated the process of deleting over 30,000 unwanted accounts from the client’s Salesforce org. This clean-up not only eliminated unnecessary data but also significantly improved the overall data quality, ensuring more accurate reporting and analytics.

- We converted the client's static dashboard into a dynamic one, allowing for real-time updates and better analysis of business metrics. The dynamic dashboard provided a more visually intuitive interface, giving users the ability to interact with key data points easily.

- To further enhance data accuracy, we created formula fields in reports to convert monthly targets into dynamic, daily-updated targets. This automation ensured that the data was always up-to-date, providing a clearer view of progress against goals.

- We added formula fields to enable percentage analysis in all gauge charts. This feature allowed the client to quickly see how close they were to meeting their goals and make data-driven decisions with greater ease.

Improved Business Insights

By transforming the dashboard into a dynamic, real-time tool, the client gained the ability to analyze data with greater clarity and accuracy. This improvement empowered stakeholders with the insights needed to drive better business decisions.

Streamlined Salesforce Org

The clean-up of 30,000 accounts resulted in a much more streamlined Salesforce org. Data management became significantly easier, and the accuracy of reports and analytics was improved, providing the client with reliable, up-to-date information.

Enhanced Decision-Making

The dynamic dashboard, with real-time updates and enhanced reporting capabilities, allowed the client to make more informed decisions. With the ability to analyze data on the fly, the client was able to optimize business processes, resulting in more efficient operations and a higher quality of service for their customers.

3- Ensuring legacy functionality remains unaffected.

4- Complexity of manual regression testing.

5- Integrations with third-party systems.

6- Communication gaps between development and QA teams.

Solutions

1- Structured regression testing for legacy features.

2- Manual execution of detailed regression test cases.

3- Version control and test case repository for custom code.

4- Improved collaboration between development and QA teams.

5- Automated testing for repetitive tasks.

Results

1- Reduced risk of breaking critical features by 80%.

2- Fewer production issues, with a 70% reduction in functionality-related issues.

3- 30% faster issue resolution.

4- Speeded up the release cycle by 50%.

5- Increased CRM stability by 90%, reducing operational disruptions.

The client needed to ensure that new customizations and updates to their Salesforce system would not negatively affect existing functionality. They required a methodical testing approach to guarantee the stability of critical features and integrations, as well as improve communication and efficiency between their development and QA teams.

We implemented a structured regression testing approach tailored to the client’s complex Salesforce environment. By focusing on both manual and automated testing, we ensured that legacy features remained unaffected by updates and new integrations. We also facilitated closer collaboration between the development and QA teams to prioritize critical tests and improve the overall testing process.

The Challenges

The Solutions

The Results

- Customizations often conflicted with legacy features, making it difficult to ensure that new updates would not disrupt existing business processes.

- Salesforce systems with extensive custom code, workflow rules, and integrations made manual testing tedious and time-consuming, while ensuring complete test coverage for business-critical processes.

- Third-party integrations, including ERP and marketing platforms, were frequently impacted by API changes, leading to potential breakdowns in functionality.

- A lack of communication and alignment between the development and QA teams resulted in missed testing priorities and delays in identifying areas of risk.

- We identified all key legacy features and developed a comprehensive set of test cases to verify their stability after each update. This structured approach ensured all essential modules were tested before releasing any updates.

- For the complex and highly customized system, we conducted manual regression testing to validate custom code, Apex triggers, and integrations, ensuring that these features remained unaffected after new updates.

- We created a centralized repository to store all test cases and track their evolution. This allowed us to maintain up-to-date tests for every feature and integration and ensured no critical modules were overlooked during testing.

- We facilitated regular meetings between development and QA teams to better understand new features and identify which areas were most at risk, improving test prioritization and reducing the risk of missed issues.

- To save time and resources, we automated repetitive tests like field validations and basic UI checks, allowing manual testing to focus on more complex scenarios.

80%

Reduced Risk of Breaking Critical Features

Our structured approach decreased the likelihood of breaking legacy features by 80%, ensuring that core business functions remained stable and uninterrupted after every release.

30%

Fewer Production Issues and Faster Resolution

By thoroughly testing custom features, the number of production issues related to broken functionality dropped by 70%. Moreover, issues that did arise were resolved 30% faster due to early identification during testing.

50%

Streamlined Salesforce Release Process

Despite the need for manual testing, our process allowed us to accelerate the release cycle by 50%, enabling faster delivery of new features and customizations to the client.

90%

Improved User Experience and CRM Stability

Regression testing led to a 90% improvement in CRM stability, significantly reducing disruptions and ensuring that day-to-day operations ran smoothly without major system failures.

- The platform’s design was built with older technologies, making it visually unappealing and difficult to navigate. As competitors embraced modern design principles, the client faced a growing gap in user experience.

- Users interacted with different platforms, each having distinct design elements and behaviors. This created confusion, making it hard for users to navigate smoothly between systems.

- Due to inefficient workflows and inconsistent layouts, users struggled to complete tasks efficiently, leading to decreased engagement and higher bounce rates. Additionally, there was an increase in customer support inquiries related to UI/UX issues.

- The platform suffered from slow loading times, especially on mobile devices. This created frustration among users, particularly those on slower networks or using older mobile devices.

- We undertook a complete redesign of the user interface with the latest design trends and technologies, ensuring a modern and appealing look. This was paired with a unified design system to bring consistency across all platforms, making interactions intuitive.

- Through research, user personas, and feedback loops, we crafted a design that prioritized ease of navigation and accessibility. We implemented mobile-first principles to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

- We worked closely with the development team to streamline code, reduce load times, and ensure faster interactions, especially for mobile users. Techniques like lazy loading and image optimization were employed.

- Prototypes were tested with actual users, and iterations were made based on feedback to ensure the final product met the user’s needs and expectations.

They required a centralized platform that could scale with their growing customer base while maintaining operational efficiency and delivering superior customer experiences.

We implemented Salesforce Sales Cloud to automate the client’s loan management system. Our approach included integrating borrower data, creating customized workflows, and improving tracking mechanisms. This streamlined their adjudication process, enabling faster loan approvals and better operational insights.

Challenges

1- Difficulty viewing images across different devices.

2- Inability to open components in PDF format in Salesforce.

3- Slow image loading times.

Solutions

1- Compressed image sizes for quicker loading and mobile compatibility.

2- Customized and redesigned Visualforce pages to enable PDF print functionality.

3- Integrated new download, save, and print options for components.

Results

1- Faster image loading times, improving efficiency by 50%.

2- Seamless image viewing across devices, with 100% mobile compatibility.

3- Ability to save components in PDF format and print them, streamlining reporting processes.

The client faced challenges in uploading and viewing images within Salesforce across different devices. Mobile access to images was particularly problematic. Additionally, they wanted the ability to create custom print views for Salesforce components so that they could save and print reports in PDF format.

We worked with the client to compress the image sizes using an external library, making it possible to view images on mobile devices. We also customized and designed Visualforce pages for various Salesforce components, enabling a print view functionality that allowed them to save and print the data as PDFs.

The Solutions

The Results

- The client struggled with large-sized images in JPG and PNG formats that would not load correctly on mobile devices, hindering accessibility for users on the go.

- Images stored in Salesforce in their original sizes caused delays in loading times, resulting in inefficiencies and slower processes for users needing quick access to images.

- The client lacked the ability to open and save components from Salesforce in PDF format, making it difficult to generate printable versions of key information for reporting or sharing.

- Image accessibility was restricted to desktop devices, creating challenges for mobile users who needed to access images while out in the field or working remotely.

- We identified the large file sizes and image formats that were causing issues and compressed them using an external library. This significantly improved mobile compatibility, allowing images to load quickly across all devices, including mobile.

- By compressing images, we reduced the load times and enhanced the user experience. Images were now accessible more quickly, reducing delays in accessing critical data.

- We customized Visualforce pages to allow components in Salesforce to be exported and saved in PDF format. This enabled users to generate reports that could be printed or saved for future reference.

- We integrated functionalities that allowed users to download and save Salesforce components in PDF format. This gave the client the ability to generate print-ready reports, increasing productivity and making data-sharing easier.

60%

Improved Mobile Accessibility

After compressing the image sizes, all images were consistently displayed across devices, ensuring 100% mobile compatibility and improving accessibility by 60%. Mobile users now had reliable access to all necessary visual data without any delays.

50%

Increased Productivity

The image loading times were reduced by 50%, making the overall user experience much more efficient. By eliminating slow load times, users were able to access and work with images faster, improving productivity across teams.

Enhanced Print Functionality

With the new PDF print view capabilities, the client was able to save and print Salesforce components. This streamlined the reporting process, saving time by automating what was previously a manual task. Users could now generate and print reports directly from Salesforce without needing to manually compile information.

What our customers are saying about us?

We had a challenge connecting Salesforce with our external data and needed a partner with the technical acumen to accomplish this goal. The Technology Mindz team was able to understand our requirements and give us exactly what we needed. We are going to save tons of time having this functionality available and now we have a reliable partner that we trust to help us grow our business.

Joel Wean

Technology Mindz was a great partner for us to help redesign our salesforce environment. We could not use our current Salesforce environment to support our business processes or sales or contract management processes. Technology Mindz has helped us change the Salesforce configuration to support our business process and customer engagement.

Dustin Fennell

Technology Mindz come our rescue with our Salesforce Org! Technology Mindz was able to provide the proper assistance when I could not get help from Salesforce Technical Support and were extremely intelligent. Every meeting brought us closer to finishing our requests, and every time we talked, announced that the request had been completed and the coding had been fixed.

Sara Hernandez

After one year of working with Technology Mindz, the experience has been excellent both in the implementation of Salesforce sales cloud and Salesforce marketing cloud. They have understood our business needs and suggested and implemented the best for us- a great Team with excellent knowledge.

Global Agricultural company

Working with Tech Mindz has been beneficial for our company. We find their weekly meetings to be a valuable tool, they are consistent interactive meetings where we can discuss new implementations and revise changes to any projects that we are in midst of. The team that we were assigned at Tech Mindz is easy to communicate with, and breaks down our communication into bullet points, so we can track progress. We are looking forward to continued growth and organization within salesforce as we continue to work with Tech Mindz.

Technology Mindz continues to be a valuable IT partner for us. We engage them in consultative advice, delivery and execution of IT initiatives, software development, as well as future discussions involving things like AI strategies.

- Restructured code as per the best practices and coding standards to ensure future maintainability.

- Evaluated existing process builder workflows and identified processes suitable for migration to flows and migrated the process builders to flows. 4 flows for each object were designed which defined proper criteria to maintain them going forward.

- Refactored apex classes, triggers, and workflows, optimizing the logic, improving query performance, and reducing redundant operations.

- Improved performance:Code refactoring led to significant improvements in system performance, resulting in faster page loads and smoother user experience.

We find their weekly meetings to be a valuable tool, they are consistent interactive meetings where we can discuss new implementations and revise changes to any projects that we are in midst of. The team that we were assigned at Tech Mindz is easy to communicate with, and breaks down our communication into bullet points, so we can track progress. We are looking forward to continued growth and organization within salesforce as we continue to work with Tech Mindz.

Dassy Fishman

Technology Mindz continues to be a valuable IT partner for us. We engage them in consultative advice, delivery and execution of IT initiatives, software development, as well as future discussions involving things like AI strategies. Their attention to detail, focused delivery, and prompt communication have been very refreshing. It has been great to have such a diverse IT partner in our circle of resources.
